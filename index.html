        <h1>JS HANDS ON-1</h1>
    1.You are provided with two numbers A and B. Your task is to add these two numbers? <br>
   <pre> CODE: const AddTwoNumbers = (a,b) => {  
        return a+b; 
    }; </pre> <hr>
    2.You are given two number first as A and second as Band check if both conditions (A<10 and A>B) are satisfied or not with the help of operators.
    <pre> CODE:const Is_Valid = (a,b) =>{
        return a<10 && a>b;
        };
       </pre> <hr>
       3.You are given two numbers A and B. You need to do the following checks:
       
       if both are divisible by 10 console true. <br>
       if both are not divisible by 10 console false. <br>
       if one of them only is divisible by 10 console true. <br>
       Use operator to do this. <br>
       <pre>CODE:const Check = (A, B) => 
        {
           if(A%10===0&& B%10===0) {
             return "true";
           }
           
           else if(A%10===0||B%10===0) {
             return "true";
             }
             else{return "false";
            };
          </pre> <hr>
       4.Find the first digit of a 4 digit number? <br>
       <pre>CODE:const First_Digit = (n) => {
        var a=n/1000;
        var b=parseInt(a);
        return b;
       };</pre> <hr>
       5. Find the last digit of a 4 digit number? <br>
       <pre>CODE:const Last_Digit = (n) => {
        var a=n%10;
        var b=parseInt(a);
        return a;
     };</pre> <hr>
     6.Find the remainder? <br>
     <pre>CODE:const Find_the_remainder = (a,b) => {
        return b%a;
    };
    </pre> <hr>
    7.Multipy two Numbers? <br>
    <pre>CODE:const Multiply_two_number = (a,b) => {
        return a*b;
    };
    </pre> <hr>
    8.Marks Calculator <br>
    Shyam has got his marks in three subjects as A, B, and C(out of 100).Write a program to calculate his total marks and his average. <br>
    <pre>CODE:const Sum = (A, B, C) => 
        {
         return A+B+C;
        };
        
        const Average = (A, B, C) => 
        {
         return (A+B+C)/3;
         
        };</pre>
